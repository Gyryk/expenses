# Expense Tracker

### A simple app for you to keep track of where your money is going. 

## Summary 
Get interactive charts that show you how much money you spent recently, where you spent it, and when you spent the most.  
Also, get a categoric breakdown of your spending habits to see which type of expenditure is costing you the most.

This app allows you to manage your money and get insights on expenses in a user-friendly manner.

## Developer's Notes

This is just a simple program I thought to make for a personal experience with Flutter/Dart.

- The date does not update when you select the new date, currently working on a fix.
- You will soon be able to set the currency symbol when you first open the app.
